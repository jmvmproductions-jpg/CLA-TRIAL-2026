                    <h2>Our Lineage and Founding Story</h2>
                    <p>Chokelab Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy was founded on a commitment to authentic, high-level instruction. We started with a simple goal: to bring the transformative power of BJJ and self-defense to the communities of Harrison, Kearny, and surrounding New Jersey towns.</p>

                    <h3>A Legacy of Champions (RMNU)</h3>
                    <div class="lineage-box">
                        <p>Our technique is directly derived from the legendary lineage of <strong>Robson Moura</strong> (Nova Uniao Jiu-Jitsu). This connection guarantees that every student—from the 5-year-old in their first Kids BJJ class to the seasoned competitor—receives instruction rooted in championship-level technique, strategy, and precision. This is the quality of Jiu-Jitsu you won't find anywhere else in North Arlington or East Newark.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Mission & Core Values</h3>
                    <p>Our mission goes beyond the mat. We are dedicated to cultivating <strong>confidence, respect, and resilience</strong> in every student. We believe BJJ is the ultimate vehicle for personal growth, providing practical self-defense skills while instilling the discipline needed to succeed in all areas of life.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Growth, Achievements, and Community Impact</h2>

Our focus on a supportive, family-like atmosphere has made us the trusted choice for martial arts in Newark and beyond.</p>
